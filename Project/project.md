# Unit 3 Project: Japanese Vocab Revision App

## Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition(Client identification)

Alessandro is a student studying Japanese ab initio in UWC ISAK Japan. He is finding it hard to revise the vocabulary for the weekly vocabulary test as most of the voabulary in the book is very spread out and hard to find. Not to mention vocabs in the textbook don't usuallu come with English meanings, which increases the hassle. As he wants a systematic way of revising for the vocabulary tests, he wants an application on his computer to assist him when he revises Japanese vocabulary while also keeping track of his progress. In addition, as the application may be used by multiple people but Alessandro wants to keep the progress tracking specific to the person, so the application requires a login system as well.

## Proposed Solution

Considering the client's requirements, an adequate solution would include a localized computer program with a GUI(Graphical User Interface) that can store data into a database. Python would be an adequate programming language for the solution as it is open source, it is mature and supported in mutiple platforms (platform-independent) including macOS, Windows, Linux.[^1]

## List of techniques used

1. 

## Computational Thinking

#### Decomposition

In computational thinking, decomposition refers to breaking a complex problem or system into parts that are easier to conceive,
understand, program, and maintain.

#### Pattern recognition, generalization and abstraction



#### Algorithms



## Development

#### OOP

#### MVP - Minimum Viable Product

In order to validate our concept of creation, we created a MVP as a prototype to make sure our concept is reliable and
achievable. 

## Criteria D: Functionality
