## List of techniques used

1. 

## Computational Thinking

#### Decomposition



#### Pattern recognition, generalization and abstraction



#### Algorithms



## Development

#### OOP

#### MVP - Minimum Viable Product

In order to validate our concept of creation, we created a MVP as a prototype to make sure our concept is reliable and
achievable. 

## Criteria D: Functionality



## Demonstration Video
